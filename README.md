# Oxono – JavaFX Board Game

**Oxono** is a digital version of the traditional board game, built with **JavaFX** as part of the **DEV3** course at **Haute École Bruxelles-Brabant (HE2B ESI)**.  
It demonstrates object-oriented design, the **MVC** pattern, and GUI development using **FXML**.

## Project Overview
- **Course:** DEV3 – Software Development  
- **Institution:** HE2B ESI (Haute École Bruxelles-Brabant)  
- **Author:** Mohamed Daouani  
- **Language:** Java 17+  
- **Framework:** JavaFX  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Scene Builder

## Educational Objectives
This project was created to:
- Apply **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles  
- Implement an interactive **graphical user interface (GUI)** with **FXML**  
- Follow the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture  
- Manage **user events and game logic** effectively  

---

## Game Description
**Oxono** is a turn-based logic and strategy game where two players alternately place their marks on a grid, aiming to align symbols or block the opponent.  

The application provides:
- Turn-based gameplay  
- Automatic win condition detection  
- Game reset and replay options  
- An intuitive and responsive **JavaFX interface**
